title: Teaching Portfolio
---

I have a quite unconventional academic career. I got an offer to start
working as a Lecturer at Blekinge Institute of Technology after
finishing my master's degree in computer science 2006. In 2012 I started
persuing a PhD in Computer Science with 20% teaching, which I graduated
from in January 2018. In July of 2017 I went back to my previous
teaching position, with 50% teaching and 50% research, this is also my
current arrangement.

I have had all possible teaching tasks during my time as a Lecturer
starting from lab assistant to course responsible and program manager. I
started my position at the Computer Communication group where I taught
basic Computer Communication & Networking courses (Cisco Certified
Network Associate etc.). During my first six years as a teacher I worked
on a vast number of courses mainly in the area of Computer Networks, and
Network- and Computer Science. These courses were backed by my Bachelor
Degree in Electrical Engineering with emphasis in Telecommunication
System combined with my Master's degree in Computer Science with
emphasis in Security Engineering.

I have been working as course responsible and as main teacher. My
teaching is recognized with high ratings both for the pedagogic view and
for my teaching style. Both students and my colleagues are very happy
with the courses I have constructed and taught.

### Program manager

I was the program manager for the two-year program called "Safety- and
Security Technology" during the period between 2009 and 2012, where I
was responsible for the pedagogic leadership. For the class of 2011 I
also lead the development of a third year resulting in a bachelor's
degree program.

### Designing of teaching environments

Together with the more theoretical part of the Computer Network courses
I also designed a few lab-rooms to fit the practical requirements from
Cisco, but also to fit our student groups and provide an efficient and
good learning environment for my students. The practical design of
lab-rooms is interesting as there are many aspects to consider. For
instance I decided to have lab-equipment close to the students, where
other universities I have visited have the equipment further away from
the students. My students are highly appreciating the presented lab
configuration, according to interviews I have conducted with my
students, and when faced with the more traditional arrangement it seems
(from my students) that the way I have decided to design the lab is
highly preferable. Mostly as my configuration allows students more
direct access to the lab-equipment than the traditional configuration.

## Pedagogical Approach

My pedagogical approach is that I as teacher should be able to act more
as a coach, aiding the students with suggestions and directions on how
to move forward in terms of learning.

I am also a strong advocate of *learning by doing*, which states that
the key for deep learning is to not only learn the theories but also
with practical experience. It is only by trying out the learned theories
and technique one can fully evolve and understand the subject. I strive
to design my courses in this direction mixing theory with practical
exercises, often in form of labs but also as "live-hacks" during
lectures. These "live-hacks" are welcomed breaks from the traditional
lectures where I demonstrate short code segments and various
configuration approaches.

### Teaching Approach

My teaching is based much upon observations from colleagues on how to
give good lectures. The observations I have made suggest that a very
enthusiastic teachers are able to transfer this enthusiasm to the
students. Enthusiastic students that are hungry to learn is a very good
start when it comes to teaching.

One example of a course that I am giving as a course responsible,
examiner and main lecturer is the course "Database Techniques". I am
redesigning the course based on previous occasions and the comments from
course evaluations from previous years. I have approximate 100 students
from four different study programs, at current course occasion (spring
2018). The course is now designed with course modules where each module
have its set of lectures and laboratory practical exercises. The
lectures are redesigned to cover both the corresponding theoretical
parts, and the more practical part that illustrates the skills and
practical tools for the course modules. The lectures are also arranged
together with supervised practical computer assignments where I together
with the teaching assistant are helping and guiding the students through
the exercises. New for this course is that I have decided not to give
course credits during the supervised exercises, instead we have a
separate occasion that give students credits for their practical
achievement. This gives more time for supervising and helping students
for the learning process in the practical part of the course. The course
has also been changed so the project more reflect the course content.
Finally have I decided that the final exam for the course will be given
as a computer aided exam. This as students now a-day are more used to
writing on a computer than with pen and paper. My vision is that this
will take off the load from the student during the stressfulness of
writing by letting them write through a computer.

### Supervising Approach

I am focusing on guidance and support when it comes to supervising
students in thesis work. I am giving the students directions and
incremental suggestions on how to move forward with the problem at hand.
This is similar to what I addressed before and relates to the concept of
*learning by doing*.

One example is the thesis I supervised for a student in the civil
engineer program in "Master of Science in Computer and Electrical
Engineering" in spring 2017. My student had a very broad idea of the
type of work he was interested in, so we narrowed it down to a specific
topic together, namely a thesis titled "An Exploratory Study on Viral
Content on Online Social Media". Throughout the period my student worked
on this project we had weekly meetings where he presented his progress
and I aided him with questions and suggestions on how to proceed and
frame his work. The thesis turned out very well and by the end my
student got a job at a company where he could continue expanding the
work he did with his thesis.

### Vision

My vision of teaching, besides for the most obvious of being and expert
knowledgeable in the subject, is that I should inspire and motivate
students. I have learned, over my years as teacher at the university,
that if I can inspire my students to take interest in my course and
subject (rather than seeing the course as just another one that needs to
be cleared before graduating) the student will also learn the course
content. A very successful approach is to give blended lectures, i.e.
give lectures that mix the theoretical concepts with practical exercises
and demonstrations.

## Teaching material

During my several years as teacher, examiner and course responsible I
have developed a vast number of lectures, assignments (often in form of
computer aided lab exercises) and exams for my courses.

### Lectures

One big challenge with lecture material is to find the right balance
between theory and practical information. One very successful approach
is to give mixed lectures, where the theoretical content is illustrated
by practical examples. This is often delivered as "live-hacks" where I
switch out from the lecture slides and show short real code examples.
This enables the students to not only focus on theory and terminology
but also shows students real life settings, i.e. what is it good for.

### Assignments/Exercises

The goal of the created assignments and exercises is to enable learning
by practical experience. Depending on the level of my students the
descriptions of the exercises have to vary quite a lot. For instance,
assignment for first and second year students requires quite detailed
description of the domain together with the actual assignment. In many
cases the assignments for these students needs to provide hints and
broad suggestions of the solution. Where as assignments for students in
later classes can be much less detailed and allow the students to reason
and discuss for a solution. In these cases can the assignment be more
like a requirement specification listing what a costumer needs and then
is it up to the student to figure out, with guidance from the
teacher(s), how to reach this.

### Written Exams

I strive to create exam questions in a way that the student writing the
exam have an opportunity to learn while writing the exam. My point of
view for a good exam question is that the student writing the exam
should be able to discuss and argue within the question and the topic
for the course. But it is unfortunately not possible to have all
questions this open ended, in such cases I strive for questions that are
not in the form where the answer is just to show that the student are
able to memorize the learning material. I am also trying to avoid simple
questions in the form of just explaining abbreviations and terminology.
But, in some occasions are the terminology and essential part of the
course content so it is essential for the students to use the right
terminology to show that he/she have understood and learned the subject.
Often is the course syllabus written in a form that the student should
be able to discuss the topics and contents of the course and often is it
necessary for the student to understand and learn corresponding
terminology and language to have a meaningful conversation about the
topics.

## Scholarship of Teaching and Learning

During my time as Adjunct and driver of the Cisco Networking Academy I
attended in bi-monthly meetings with other Cisco Academies. Part of
these were meeting that I co-arranged (with other colleagues at Blekinge
Institute of Technology) at Blekinge Institute of Technology.

I also did attend the International Academy Conference 2007 in Istanbul
Turkey within the Cisco Networking Academy program.

Further more, I have given guest lectures to the courses "Research
Orientation in Security" and "Industrial Marketing --- Theory and
Practice" where I have explained my research focus and results.

I have also involved students in terms of scientific approach in several
of my courses where my students were given the task to select recent
publications or given a selection of publications; to foster critical
approach and scientific methods.

## Non Academic Pedagogical Activities

I have been active in various pedagogical activities for other groups
than students at the university in the following settings:

Hired teaching consultant

:   --- I was contacted by Business Security in 2009 to give a guest
    series on the topic of Network Security for a group of about 10
    persons.

Spring break activity for middle-school students

:   --- I did arrange an activity for high-school pupils during spring
    break ("sport lov") of 2008. This activity involved design and
    construction of a Lego robot and programming of this robot.

Forskar fredag

:   --- I was invited speaker for the local event called "Forskar
    fredag" held in Kreativum during two consecutive years. Where I met
    and had a discussion with high-school pupils regarding privacy
    threats in online social media platforms.

Unga forskare

:   --- I was contacted by Kreativum in 2015 to give a inspirational
    speech for high school pupils during the event called "Unga
    forskare".

Local Radio

:   --- During spring of 2018 I did get contacted and gave various
    interviews and pedagogical talks for the local radio stations 'P4 -
    Radio Blekinge' and 'P4 - Radio Kristianstad'.

Expert panel

:   --- I was invited as an expert on social media to a panel that took
    place at "Högskolan i Kristianstad" in April 2018.

## Other Pedagogical Merits

During my time as Adjunct and driver of the Cisco Networking Academy did
I attend in bi-monthly meetings with other Cisco Academies. Part of
these were meeting that I co-arranged (with other colleagues at Blekinge
Institute of Technology) at Blekinge Institute of Technology. These
meeting acted both as updates to the recent shifts in industry but also
as forum for all the teachers withing the academy program in the
southern part of Sweden.
