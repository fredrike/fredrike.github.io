I started working as a teacher with an Adjunct position at Blekinge Institute of Technology in January 2006. I have been involved in every part of teaching, starting from lab- assistant to course responsible and program manager during these years.
I’ve also been the lead developer of introducing Cisco Certification into the Computer Network courses at BTH (mainly **Computer Communications** and **Network Technologies 1-2** and **Communications- and Network Security**). I was the only one at BTH with the right competence to deliver Computer Networks courses within the Cisco Certification Network Associate program during a period of three years, as Cisco requires instructors to pass their competence assurance program.

# *Program manager*
I was the program manager for the two-year program called “Safety- and Security Technology” during the period between 2009 and 2012, where I was responsible for the pedagogic leader- ship. For the class of 2011 I also lead the development of a third year resulting in a bachelor’s degree program.

# *Designing of teaching environments*

Together with the more theoretical part of the Computer Network courses I also designed a few lab-rooms to fit the practical requirements from Cisco, but also to fit our student groups and provide an efficient and good learning environment for my students. The practical design of lab-rooms is interesting as there are many aspects to consider. For instance I decided to have lab-equipment close to the students, where other universities I have visited have the equipment further away from the students. My students are highly appreciating the presented lab configuration, according to interviews I have conducted with my students, and when faced with the more traditional arrangement it seems (from my students) that the way I have decided to design the lab is highly preferable. Mostly as my configuration allows students more direct access to the lab-equipment than the traditional configuration.
