title: Script to extract movies from an img file.
---

The following scipt can be used to extract movies from an img file. The `minlength=600` reflects that the movie must be 600 seconds to be included.

```sh
#/bin/sh

for IMG in `find . -iname \*.img`; do
  DIR=`dirname $IMG`
  basename ${IMG%.img}
  /Applications/MakeMKV.app/Contents/MacOS/makemkvcon \
    --minlength=600 mkv \
    iso:${IMG} all `dirname ${IMG}`
  
  # Rename files  
  for MKV in `ls $DIR/title*.mkv`; do 
    F=`basename ${MKV}`
    mv -v $MKV ${IMG%.img}.${F:5:2}.mkv
  done
done

```
