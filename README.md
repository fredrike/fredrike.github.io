I am both a practitioner (both software and hardware vise) and theoretician. I am also result driven with details for high quality, e.g. for my thesis I have two published ISI-journal publications. This quality aim is also present in my teaching, where I in general also have high scores on the course evaluations of the vast number of courses I have taught over the years. Moreover I am easy-going and supportive, where I always find time to help my colleagues and friends with whatever problem they might have.

## Career

I'm have a PhD in Computer Science from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.bth.se/eng/about-bth/organisation/faculty-of-computing/dida/) at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH) in Sweden. I have a long experience (15+ years) of working in academica as both teacher and researcher.

### Blekinge Institute of Technology 2006 -- 2020

I worked at Blekinge Institute of Technology as a full time Lecturer and program manager for the *Safety and Security Technology* undergraduate program for six years, before starting persuing a Ph.D. During this time I did teach a vast number of courses at both undergraduate and graduate level, including Computer Networks courses with CCNA and CCSP elements, Databases, and various Network Security courses.

I finished my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden in January 2018.  My Ph.D. studies have included both national and international collaborations, for instance, I spent my first Ph.D year employed at UC Davis where I together with professor Felix S. Wu developed a crawler for public Facebook data and a searchable database (via a webinterface). I have been working closely with Dr. Piotr Bródka at Department of Computational Intelligence, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology in Poland with research on information cascade on social graphs, created from my substantial dataset collected by my crawler. My research have gained lot of attention and just recently I was interviewed by New York Times ([{https://nyti.ms/2KDfaHU}](https://nyti.ms/2KDfaHU)) regarding my research and dataset collected from Facebook.

### Scandinavian Airline Systems AB (SAS) 2019 -- 2020

I worked in the Commercial Analytics team as a Data Scientist, making smart insights from large data sets to support decision makers in the organization.  All of the following examples included full stack work, from data orchestration/data engineering (ingesting, preparing and cleaning in Azure Data Factory / Azure Data Lake / Azure databases), to model development (including training, evaluating, and model fitting), and end user reports (built i Microsoft Power BI) and/or  application integration via Azure Dataflow. Some of the projects include:

* Regression model for sales forecast and revenue baseline.
* Classification and prediction of delayed flights.
* Association rule learning to gain insights on ancillary sales.

### Consid AB 2020 ---

I am currently working at Consid AB as a Data Scientist.

#### Assignments

* 2021 --- BI Specialist Boverket, Karlskrona.

* 2020 -- 2021 E.ON, Malmö I worked in the Digital Bussiness group as a Digital Analytics Specialist. Some of the work included:

  * Leading and execution of a site-wide user consent banner (GDPR) on eon.se.
  * Tagging user flows in Google Tag Manager for the eon.se site.
  * Building and maintaining user behaviour reports in Google Datastudio with site data from Google Analytics.
