title: Statement of Research

My main research topic is collection, organization and analysis of Big Data from social media using Machine Learning combined with Complex Networks.

I started my research career in 2012 with a publication in SocialCom 2012 regarding user privacy threats. This was the starting point of my PhD studies. Over the years my research interest have switched from security and social media (including crawling of social media [@nia2012a]) to the field of Machine Learning and Network Science, which have been my focus for the last three years.

From the social media data collected by my tool
[@erlandsson2013a; @erlandsson2015a], social networks (that we are
calling Social Interaction Networks [@nia2012a]) have been created and
my last publications are addressing how to identify influential users in
these networks using machine learning. In one of my most recent
publication [@erlandsson2017a], I can show that it is possible to use
data mining methods to identify seeds for information spreading models.

I also have a publication [@erlandsson2017b] addressing the challenge of
how a smart sampling technique can be used to improve data collection
from social media. This study have gained media attention and in mid
April 2018 I did an interview with New York Times that showed interest
in my research.

Although the network science field is quite new for me, I can really see
the potential for me to make an impact here. With strong publications in
both ways of identifying influential users and seeds for information
cascade models.

The types of networks I've mostly been working with are multilayer
networks created from Facebook data collected by my own crawler. This
data is not traditional ego graphs but instead is the data based on
users' interactions on public groups. Hence have the networks been
created by projecting user-to-posts interaction into user-to-user
interaction.
